# Work Day Scheduler

## An application which allows you to plan out your work day with a handy day planner! Enter your to-do list for the appropriate hour, hit the save button, and your list won't dissapear upon refresh. Time slots are dynamically color-coded: green for in the future, red for in the present, and white for in the past. With a lot of help from my classmates, I have written code that I'm sure will be an excellent reference in the future. This challenge has helped me bridge the gap in my understanding of local storage, and javascript as a whole seems a lot less daunting now. Thanks for your consideration, and happy coding.
